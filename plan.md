# The Plan

## This weekend: March 3rd - March 5th

1. This weekend I am going to spend as much time outside as possible having fun and reflecting on the week. 
2. On Sunday, I will do what I always do and take care of laundry, meal prep, and cleaning. Then I will sit down and make a detailed plan for the week.

## Next Week: March 6th - March 10th

1. On Sunday I will dive more into detail what this week will look like, but there are several things I already know I would like to accomplish:
    - Rearrange my room so that the morning sun does not shine directly into my face while I'm at my desk. 
    - Invest in sleep hygiene by getting blackout curtains, new sheets, and new pillows.
    - Go over my budget for the next 9 months. 
    - Schedule in time to study and reflect. 
    - Meet with other members of the cohort. 
    - Continue waking up early, surfing, going to the climbing gym, and doing yoga.
    - Finish reading and work on implementing ideas from "Atomic Habits," by James Clear.  

## Final Week: March 13th - 17th

1. Get ready to go!
    - Read forward and prepare for MOD 1.
    - Relax and enjoy my final moments of freedom. 
    - Take care of any last minute administrative duties. 
    - Perfect my calendar. 
    - Continue waking up early, surfing, going to the climbing gym, and doing yoga. 
    - Read another book on self-development to prepare mentally for MOD 1.
